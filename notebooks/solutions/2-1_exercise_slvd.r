## Solution.
library(metafor)
dat.bcg <- escalc(measure = "RR", ai = tpos, bi = tneg, ci = cpos, di = cneg, data = dat.bcg)
## escalc() returns the log(RR).

## Solution.
dat.bcg

head(dat.bcg)

## Solution.
## yi is the newly calculated effect size, it is a log(relative risk). In terms of interpretation:
## - a negative value means that the vaccine indeed works.
## - yi = 0 means there is no effect at all, yi > 0 means the vaccine is harmful.
## vi is the corresponding variance.

## Solution.
exp(dat.bcg$yi)

## Solution.
library(metafor)
dat.bcg <- escalc(measure = "OR", ai = tpos, bi = tneg, ci = cpos, di = cneg, data = dat.bcg)
dat.bcg

## Solution.
dat.bcg <- escalc(measure = "OR", ai = tpos, bi = tneg, ci = cpos, di = cneg, data = dat.bcg)
exp(dat.bcg$yi)

## Solution.
## We are interested in verbal abilities and the other two correlation coefficient 
## refer to other subscales/subsets. 
"The first one, r = 0.234"

## Solution.
## Perform a Fisher's z transformation on r for the most general measures,

r <- 0.234
n <- 76
z.r <- 0.5 * log((1 + r)/(1 - r))
z.r

## Solution.
var.z.r <- 1 / (n - 3)
var.z.r

## Solution.
(se.z.r <- sqrt(var.z.r)) ## (...) is a shortcut for print(...)

## Solution.
## You also can use escalc() to calculate the Fisher's r-to-z transformed correlation 
## coefficient.
escalc(measure="ZCOR", ri = 0.234, ni = 76)

## Solution.
## Here is the variance and SE for the raw correlation coefficient
(var.r <- (1-r^2)^2/(n-1))
sqrt(var.r)
