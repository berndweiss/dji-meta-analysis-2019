To start the exercises and the Jupyter notebooks, push the "launch binder" button. It hopefully takes only about 30 seconds to start the notebook. Then open the folder `/notebooks`.

Please also note:

- Please avoid starting multiple binder instances (we have a max of 40!) and use the "Quit" button to close your notebooks.  

- Solved exercises can be found in folder `notebooks/solutions`.

- A static HTML version of all solved notebooks can be found in `notebooks/solutions/html`.

- To download the entire repository, use the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner; choose "Download ZIP" if you have no clue what the other options mean.
